### Ruleset 
##### Board

As you can see, there are _20 fields in total_. You begin placing your piece(s) at the right side of this presentation
on your starting position respectively ```this can be either the upper two fields or the lower two fields```.
You then move from the lower end of the two fields to the outer most side, where you will then move down the green line
to the outer most left side, until you move to the outer sides again ```up or down, depending on the player```
and move your piece heading for the starting position. You will then have finished one round with your piece, after 
moving your piece one field before the starting position ```congrats, you've completed one round```.
The flower-like symbols indicate a safe spot, more on that later.

##### Pieces and dice
![Piecedice](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NwexEmdfjEg/UJtPKjWy4ZI/AAAAAAAAAVs/0iru1L0JwqA/s1600/Dice.jpg)

We are playing with 4 dice at a time, which are pyramid dice meaning that you can only throw a four at best, since
only the edges pointing upwards are counted. Also, we introduce a bit of luck and probability calculating into the
game by colouring the edges so that, if you were to throw the dice with not painted edges pointing upwards, you would
have thrown a plain zero and your turn would be over ```let's hope that's not the case for you```.

> Each player has the same amount of pieces, or stones if you will, which are **seven** in total

##### How do we play?

The player will have a go at the dice, after which the current player takes his move, thereby finishing the turn.
Each turn, after throwing, a player can either move an already placed stone or place a new stone as many fields as
he has thrown. Of course, you cannot move or place a stone at a field that is already occupied by yourself. But what
you can do is, moving your stone to the position of the enemy's stone, whereby you will take his place and he will
have to reset his stone to his starting pile.
Remember those flower-like fields? Well, those are our safe harbours; the enemy will not be able to usurp our
position there, also they double as a throw-again field.

> Remember, there may be rounds ahead, where you are unable to do anything at all, because of which you will 
need to end your turn 

##### How do I win?

Easy, just make all your pieces work for you by letting all seven complete their full rounds.
But **keep your mind sharp**, you need to have the exact throw to get your stone off the board,
don't let those **Hittites** fool you.
